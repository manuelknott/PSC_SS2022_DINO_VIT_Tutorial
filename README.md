# Facilitated Machine Learning with images using pre-trained Vision Transformers

This Tutorial is part of the 2022 Summer School "[Application of Machine Learning in Plant Sciences](https://www.plantsciences.uzh.ch/en/teaching/summerschool.html)" organised by the Zurich-Based Plant Science Center.

## Abstract

This hands-on programming session will be about Vision Transformers pre-trained with the DINO method. We will use these models to convert images to lower-dimensional representations that enable the usage of shallow machine learning models for downstream tasks such as classification or clustering. This procedure can be superior to other approaches when the number of available training samples is small or when no GPUs for training Deep Neural Networks are available. We will demonstrate the method by classifying fruit quality based on public image data sets. Participants are welcome to experiment with their own data sets during the session. We will work with Python/Jupyter, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
